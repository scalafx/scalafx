[ScalaFX][1] 16.0.0-R25 supports JavaFX 16. This release was tested to work with Java 11 and Java 16. It can be used
with Scala 2.12, 2.13, and Scala 3.

The main new feature of this release is the simpler way to crate custom `cellFactory` ([Issue #256][256]). The
boilerplate code generation was moved behind the scenes. A correct `cellFactory` can be defined with a simple lambda.
For instance, here we render a cell content as a Circle of a given color:

```scala
cellFactory = (cell, color) => {
  cell.graphic = Circle(fill = color, radius = 8)
}
```

Compare to the more verbose way that had to be done in previous versions to endure that empty cells are rendered
correctly:

```scala
cellFactory = { _ =>
  new TableCell[Person, Color] {
    item.onChange { (_, _, newColor) =>
      graphic =
        if (newColor != null)
          new Circle {
            fill = newColor
            radius = 8
          }
        else
          null
    }
  }
}
```

You can find a brief description [here][faq_TableView_with_Custom_cell]. There are several examples of how to
use `cellFactory` use with different controls in [scalafx-demos].

Note that if you use the old way of assigning `cellFactory` you will need to be more explicit and provide type
annotations for lambda arguments. Without that some old code may not compile with 16.0.0-R25.

### New Features

* [Issue #256][256] - Change custom cellFactory assignment methods to help in correct implementation that avoids
  artifacts

### Bug fixes:

* [Issue #360][360] - Implicit should convert `jfxa.Application.Parameters` to `JFXApp3.Parameters`

### Updates to documentation and demos:

* [Issue #352][352] - Update scaladoc demos to use `JFXApp3`. Big thanks to @rom1dep for converting the demos.
* [Issue #353][353] - Update scalafx.org documentation to use `JFXApp3` instead of deprecated `JFXApp`.
