ScalaFX 2.2.76-R11 was tested against JavaFX 2.2.76.

* Compatibility braking changes:

    - Issue #171: ScalaDocs are now generated with links to sources
    - Issue #172: ScalaDocs are now generated with hierarchy diagrams
    - Issue #173: Added wrappers for `SeparatorMenuItem` and `CustomMenuItem` (thanks to Roman Hargrave)
