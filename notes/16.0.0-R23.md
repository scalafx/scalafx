[ScalaFX][1] 16.0.0-R26 support JavaFX 16. This release was tested to work with Java 11 and Java 16. It can be used with
Scala 2.12, 2.13, and **Scala 3**.

Main reason for this release is to publish binaries for final release of Scala 3.0.0

#### Changes

* [Issue #349][349] - Update to Scala 3.0.0-RC3 to final release 3.0.0

  longer works in Scala 3.

* [Issue #137][137] - Creation of a `TableView` not possible. This issue due to bug in Scala compiler 2.12, no longer
  present in Scala 2.13, nor Scala 3.
