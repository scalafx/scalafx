/** Illustrated [[https://github.com/scalafx/scalafx/issues/102 Issue 102]]
  *
  * When event handler is created from a code block (rather than a function),
  * only it's last instruction is used when event handler is invoked.
  * Everything else is invoked only once when event handler is created.
  *
  * When we run this application, with bug 102 in effect, and click three tomes on the
  * button, we will have following printout
  * {{{
  *   Creating primary stage ...
  *   Button 1 - Message 1
  *   Creating primary stage - done
  *   Button 1 - Message 2
  *   Button 1 - Message 2
  *   Button 1 - Message 2
  * }}}
  * Notice that first `println` in the handler is executed during construction,
  * before it is shown on the screen. Clicking on Button 1 produces only the second message.
  * If the event handler was working correctly we should have:
  * {{{
  *   Creating primary stage ...
  *   Creating primary stage - done
  *   Button 1 - Message 1
  *   Button 1 - Message 2
  *   Button 1 - Message 1
  *   Button 1 - Message 2
  *   Button 1 - Message 1
  *   Button 1 - Message 2
  * }}}
