/**
 * Represents an operating system clipboard, on which data may be placed during, for example, cut, copy, and paste operations.
 *
 * To access the general system clipboard, use the following code:
 *
 * {{{
 * val clipboard = Clipboard.systemClipboard
 * }}}
 *
 * There is only ever one instance of the system clipboard in the application, so it is perfectly acceptable to stash a reference to it somewhere handy if you so choose.
 *
 * The Clipboard operates on the concept of having a single conceptual item on the clipboard at any one time -- though it may be placed on the clipboard in different formats.
 *
 * Example use:
 * {{{
 *   val clipboard = Clipboard.systemClipboard
 *   val content = new ClipboardContent()
 *   content.putString("Some text")
 *   content.putHtml("<b>Some</b> text")
 *   clipboard.content = content
 * }}}
 *
 * Alternative use:
 * {{{
 *    Clipboard.systemClipboard.content = ClipboardContent(
 *      DataFormat.PlainText -> "Some text",
 *      DataFormat.Html -> "<b>Some</b> text"
 *    )
 * }}}
 *
 * Caution when putting files into the clipboard. The recommended method is:
 * {{{
 *   val content = new ClipboardContent()
 *   content.putString("Some text")
 *
 * }}}
 *
 * Wraps a $JFX [[ $URL0 $FC]].
 *
 * @constructor Creates a new $FC from a $JFX one.
 * @param delegate A $JFX $FC to be wrapped. Its default value is a new $JFX $FC.
 * @define FC   Clipboard
 * @define URL0 http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/input/Clipboard.html
 * @define JFX  JavaFX
