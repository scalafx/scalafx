ScalaFX is a UI DSL written within the Scala Language that sits on top of JavaFX 2.x and and JavaFX 8.
This means that every ScalaFX application is also a valid Scala application.
By extension it supports full interoperability with Java and can run anywhere the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
and JavaFX 2.0 or JavaFX 8 are supported.

## Package Structure

ScalaFX package structure corresponds to JavaFX package structure, for instance `scalafx.animation` corresponds to `javafx.animation`.

## Example Usage

A basic ScalaFX application is created creating an object that is an instance of `scalafx.application.JFXApp`.
Following Java FX theatre metaphor, it contains a `stage` that contains a `scene`.
A `stage` roughly corresponds to a window in a typical UI environment.
The `scene` holds UI content presented to the user.
In the example below, the content is a pane with a single `label` component.

```scala
package hello

import scalafx.application.JFXApp
import scalafx.application.JFXApp.PrimaryStage
import scalafx.geometry.Insets
import scalafx.scene.Scene
import scalafx.scene.control.Label
import scalafx.scene.layout.BorderPane

object HelloWorld extends JFXApp {
  stage = new PrimaryStage {
    title = "Hello"
    scene = new Scene {
      root = new BorderPane {
        padding = Insets(25)
        center = new Label("Hello World")
      }
    }
  }
}
```
